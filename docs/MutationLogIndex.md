# Mutation Log Index

A chronological index of structural mutations observed in the Jumping VPN organism.

---

## Core Identity Mutations

- **Mutation 52: Identity Spine**  
  Sessions now carry a non-fungible lineage. Identity is structural, not metadata.

- **Mutation 53: Temporal Anchors**  
  Sessions embed monotonic time. Replays and time-warp attempts are detectable.

- **Mutation 54: Behavioral Envelope**  
  Sessions develop behavioral signatures. Gait becomes part of identity.

- **Mutation 55: Adversarial Memory**  
  The organism retains scars. Attacks leave persistent, queryable traces.

## Foundational Mutations

- **Mutation 01: Birth of the Organism**  
  The first spark. A VPN that refuses to be a tunnel.

- **Mutation 07: Veil Identity**  
  The organism learns to hide its true shape. Identity becomes obfuscated.

- **Mutation 14: Drift-Aware Routing**  
  The network becomes unstable by design. Routing adapts to entropy.

- **Mutation 21: Stateless Statefulness**  
  State is externalized, yet continuity is preserved. Stateless ≠ forgetful.

## Upcoming

- **Mutation 56: Persistence Layer / The Refusal to Die**  
  Even when disconnected, the organism remembers. Sessions are never truly gone.

Each mutation is a structural shift — not a feature, but a philosophical commitment.
