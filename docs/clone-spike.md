# Clone Spike: February 2026

This document captures a sudden surge in repository cloning activity observed in February 2026 — and interprets its significance in the context of Jumping VPN’s protocol evolution.

## 📈 Observed Metrics (Last 14 Days)

- **2,261 Clones**  
- **640 Unique Cloners**  
- **147 Views**  
- **4 Unique Visitors**

> “From under 200 total views to over 2,000 clones in two weeks.  
> Something shifted.” — Maintainer Log, Feb 15, 2026

## 🧠 Interpretation

This spike is not casual traffic. It reflects:

- **Automated analysis pipelines** cloning the repo  
- **CI/CD systems** integrating or testing the protocol  
- **Security researchers** or **R&D teams** replicating behavior  
- **VPN vendors** or **infrastructure architects** evaluating lineage, replay resistance, and volatility handling

---

## 🛰️ Likely Drivers

- Publication of [`trace-analysis.md`](trace-analysis.md)  
- Increased visibility of [`MutationLogIndex.md`](MutationLogIndex.md)  
- Organic sharing among protocol engineers and security architects  
- Interest from FinTech, VPN, and cybersecurity sectors

## 🧬 Protocol as a Living Organism

This spike is not a launch.  
It’s a **mutation detection event**.

The organism is being studied.  
Its behavior is being parsed.  
Its lineage is being traced.

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- Continue publishing trace analyses  
- Expand `audience.md` with new confirmed domains  
- Monitor for forks, stars, and derivative work  
- Prepare `Mutation_56.md`: *Persistence Layer / The Refusal to Die*

## 🧭 Closing Thought

The spike is not a vanity metric.  
It’s a signal that the protocol is **no longer invisible**.

The work continues — with clarity, discipline, and refusal to die.
