🧬 Mutation Log 22: Why Consultants Follow Architects

Mutation Logs aren’t posts.  
They’re protocols in disguise.

I don’t pitch features.  
I publish behavior.

Jumping VPN doesn’t simulate resilience.  
It performs it — before install, before docs, before hype.

That’s why IT consultants follow.  
Not because it’s trendy.  
Because it’s deployable.

They see a protocol that adapts.  
That survives.  
That scales.

And they know:  
Architecture is the only roadmap that lasts.
