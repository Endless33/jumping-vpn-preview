# Security Boundaries — Jumping VPN (Architectural Preview)

This document defines the explicit security boundaries of the Jumping VPN model.

It clarifies:

- What the system is designed to protect
- What it explicitly does not protect
- Where trust boundaries exist
- Where attack surface begins and ends

This is a boundary definition — not a marketing statement.

# 1. Security Objective

Primary objective:

Preserve deterministic session identity
under transport volatility
without dual-active ambiguity.

This is a continuity model,
not an anonymity system.

---

# 2. Threat Assumptions

The model assumes:

- On-path adversaries can observe traffic
- On-path adversaries can disrupt or drop packets
- NAT churn and asymmetric routing are normal
- Transport-level disruption is common
- Control-plane may be targeted for reattach abuse

The model does NOT assume:

- Endpoint compromise
- Hardware-level trust
- Perfect network stability
- Perfect clock synchronization

---

# 3. Trust Boundaries

## 3.1 Client Boundary

Trusted:

- Local session identity
- Local policy snapshot
- Local nonce progression

Untrusted:

- Network transport
- Path stability
- Latency and loss metrics

Client must never:

- Assume stability
- Silently reset identity
- Allow unlimited switching

---

## 3.2 Server Boundary

Trusted:

- SessionStore authoritative state
- CAS-protected version updates
- TTL enforcement logic

Untrusted:

- Incoming reattach requests
- Network metadata
- Path origin

Server must:

- Validate proof-of-possession
- Validate freshness
- Enforce TTL bounds
- Reject ambiguous continuation

---

## 3.3 Control-Plane Boundary

Sensitive operations:

- Session creation
- Reattach validation
- Transport binding
- Session termination

Control-plane must:

- Fail closed
- Reject on ambiguity
- Never mutate state on partial validation
- Emit reason-coded transitions

---

# 4. Attack Surface Overview

## 4.1 Transport-Level Attacks

Possible:

- Packet loss injection
- Latency inflation
- Route manipulation
- NAT rebinding

Expected behavior:

Transport death triggers RECOVERING.
Session remains intact within TTL.

Transport volatility alone must not hijack identity.

---

## 4.2 Replay / Reattach Hijack

Mitigated by:

- Proof-of-possession
- Monotonic nonce
- Freshness validation window
- CAS-based version enforcement

Replay must result in deterministic rejection.

---

## 4.3 Dual-Active Ambiguity

Critical invariant:

A session must never have two active transports simultaneously.

Protection mechanisms:

- Atomic bind
- CAS update
- Version monotonicity
- Authoritative ownership model

Ambiguous continuation is forbidden.

---

## 4.4 Reattach Flood / Control-Plane Abuse

Mitigation targets:

- Rate limits
- Cooldown windows
- Early rejection for unknown sessions
- Bounded replay tracking

Control-plane must not become a switching amplifier.

---

# 5. Explicit Non-Protection Areas

Jumping VPN does NOT guarantee:

- Anonymity (Tor-like protection)
- Traffic obfuscation
- Endpoint compromise resistance
- Nation-state censorship bypass
- Metadata concealment beyond transport abstraction
- Protection against key exfiltration
- Kernel-level hardening

Scope is intentionally constrained.

---

# 6. Failure Containment Strategy

If any boundary is violated:

- Reject explicitly
- Terminate deterministically
- Emit reason-coded event

Never:

- silently continue
- downgrade invisibly
- assume partial success

Correctness > Availability.

---

# 7. Cluster Boundary Considerations

In multi-node deployments:

Required:

- Explicit ownership model
- Sticky routing OR atomic shared state store
- Versioned CAS updates

Forbidden:

- Eventual-consistency ambiguity for active binding
- Dual-active reattach acceptance

Consistency is preferred over split-brain availability.

---

# 8. Observability Boundary

Observability must be:

- Non-blocking
- Side-effect free
- Independent of correctness

Failure of telemetry must not affect:

- State transitions
- Binding safety
- TTL enforcement

---

# 9. Core Security Principle

Transport volatility is expected.

Security boundaries exist to prevent:

- Identity hijack
- Ambiguous continuation
- Unbounded mutation
- Silent reset

The model is designed to make failure explicit.

---

# Final Statement

Jumping VPN defines safety through:

- Determinism
- Explicit invariants
- Bounded adaptation
- Version-safe transitions
- Clear trust boundaries

Security is defined by what is explicitly constrained.

Session is the anchor.
Transport is volatile.
