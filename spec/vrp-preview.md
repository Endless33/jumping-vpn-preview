# 🧬 VRP — Veil Routing Protocol (Preview Spec)

**VRP** is a behavioral routing protocol designed for drift, not stability.  
It routes based on motion, not geography.  
It adapts under pressure, not under configuration.

## 🔁 Core Principles

- **Drift-native routing**  
  VRP does not rely on fixed nodes or static paths.  
  It routes based on dynamic topology and behavioral signals.

- **Veil Identity**  
  Packets carry no geographic or origin metadata.  
  Identity is behavioral, not declarative.

- **Non-geographic packet flow**  
  Routing decisions are made without reference to physical location.  
  VRP treats the network as a fluid, not a map.

- **Operator-grade logic**  
  Designed for environments where failure is not theoretical — it’s constant.  
  VRP adapts in real time, under real pressure.

## 🧠 Architectural Behavior

- Evaluates topology continuously  
- Senses drift and adapts without restart  
- Survives node loss without rerouting  
- Behaves like a multi-agent system  
- Encodes motion logic directly into packet flow

| Feature                | VRP                        | OpenVPN / WireGuard         |
|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Routing basis          | Behavioral drift           | Static configuration        |
| Identity model         | Veil (non-declarative)     | IP-based                    |
| Topology adaptation    | Real-time, pressure-native | Manual or restart-based     |
| Geographic awareness   | None                       | Required                    |
| Failure response       | Embedded in flow           | External recovery logic     |
