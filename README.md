# 🧬 Jumping VPN — Architectural Preview

Jumping VPN is a **session‑centric VPN architecture** built for environments where **transport volatility is the norm**, not an exception.

Traditional VPNs bind identity to a single transport.  
Jumping VPN binds identity to a **persistent session**, while transports remain **replaceable, volatile attachments**.

This repository contains:

- architectural documentation  
- behavioral models  
- contract‑first demo  
- mutation logs  
- minimal behavioral prototypes  
- full demo engine (deterministic, observable, reproducible)

It is **not** a production release.

## 🎥 Demo Engine (Contract‑First)

Jumping VPN uses a **contract‑first demo model**:  
behavior is defined before implementation.

Demo documents:

- [`DEMO_SPEC.md`](docs/demo/DEMO_SPEC.md)
- [`DEMO_OUTPUT_FORMAT.md`](docs/demo/DEMO_OUTPUT_FORMAT.md)
- [`DEMO_SCENARIO.md`](docs/demo/DEMO_SCENARIO.md)
- [`DEMO_TIMELINE.jsonl`](docs/demo/DEMO_TIMELINE.jsonl)
- [`STATUS.md`](docs/demo/STATUS.md)
- [`REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/demo/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)

The demo contract validates:

- identity anchoring  
- volatility modeling  
- multipath scoring  
- bounded adaptation  
- deterministic transport switch  
- recovery back to `ATTACHED`  

**Session is the anchor.  
Transport is volatile.**

## 🚀 Quick Demo Run

The demo engine is fully self‑contained and runs locally.

### Requirements
- Python 3.10+

### Run demo

```bash
python run_demo.py

This generates:

demo_output.jsonl — raw protocol event stream

DEMO_METRICS.json — metrics

DEMO_DASHBOARD.json — compact dashboard

DEMO_ECOSYSTEM/ — full artifact package

DEMO_PACKAGE.zip — zipped lifecycle package

The demo is deterministic, observable, reproducible.

🔎 Core Thesis

Modern networks are inherently unstable:

mobile networks flap

NAT mappings expire

cross‑border routes degrade

packet loss spikes

paths die unpredictably

Most VPNs treat this as failure.Jumping VPN treats it as modeled behavior.

Separation of Concerns

Session identity — persistent, cryptographically anchored

Transport binding — volatile, replaceable, auditable

Transport death ≠ session death (within bounded policy).

🧠 Architectural Model

Jumping VPN is defined by behavior over time, not by static configuration.

Session‑Centric Identity

The session is the source of truth:

identity belongs to the session

transport is an attachment

reattachment preserves continuity

Deterministic Recovery

Transport failover is:

explicit

reason‑coded

rate‑limited

policy‑bounded

auditable

No silent renegotiation.No uncontrolled resets.

Volatility as State

Instability is represented explicitly:

BIRTH

ATTACHED

VOLATILE

DEGRADED

REATTACHING

RECOVERING

TERMINATED

Transitions are deterministic and logged.

🧬 Mutation Logs

Mutation Logs document the evolution of:

session lifecycle

volatility modeling

bounded adaptation

reconnect semantics

protocol invariants

They serve as architectural archaeology.

🌐 Real UDP Prototype (Behavioral Validation)

A minimal UDP prototype demonstrates:

session creation

transport death

explicit reattach

proof‑based validation

server‑side TransportSwitch

continuity without identity reset

See:

poc/realudpprototype.py

poc/README_udp.md

This is behavioral validation, not production cryptography.

🛡 Threat Model & Boundaries

Jumping VPN defines:

adversary assumptions

deterministic failure boundaries

allowed transitions

bounded adaptation policies

Recommended reading:

docs/core/threat-model.md

docs/core/security-boundary.md

docs/core/invariants.md

docs/core/state-machine.md

🚫 Explicit Non‑Goals

Jumping VPN does not aim to provide:

anonymity

censorship bypass

endpoint compromise protection

anti‑forensics

universal VPN replacement

Scope is intentionally narrow:

session continuity under transport volatility

🔬 Open Engineering Questions

Active research areas:

distributed session ownership

clustered state replication

formal verification

QUIC‑based transport experiments

performance under high churn

Behavioral correctness takes priority.

🎯 Intended Audience

Relevant for:

mobile infrastructure teams

fintech platforms with session collapse issues

security architects designing deterministic recovery

operators exploring transport abstraction

🧭 Philosophy

Jumping VPN is an architectural thesis:

behavior first

contracts first

rigor over hype

Architecture does not require permission.It requires consistency.

📈 Status

Jumping VPN is in architectural validation.

This repository:

is not production‑ready

does not include hardened cryptography

exposes staged documentation

focuses on behavioral modeling

🤝 Technical Discussions

Open to discussions on:

deterministic recovery

bounded adaptation

session persistence

operator‑grade observability

Final Principle

Transport instability is not an anomaly —it is the default condition of modern networks.

Jumping VPN treats volatility as modeled behavior, not as failure.

Session remains the anchor.Transports come and go.
