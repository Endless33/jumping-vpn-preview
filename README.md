# 🧬 Jumping VPN — Preview

**Jumping VPN** is a behavioral VPN built on top of **VRP** — a routing protocol designed for drift, not stability.

This repository is a **public preview** of the architecture, mutation logs, and protocol fragments behind Jumping VPN.

---

## 🔧 What’s Inside

- `docs/MutationLogs/` — architectural logs (21–…)  
- `spec/vrp-preview.md` — early protocol notes  
- `README.md` — this file

---

## 🧠 What Makes Jumping VPN Different

- **VRP (Veil Routing Protocol)** — routes based on behavior, not geography  
- **Drift-native** — no fixed nodes, no static paths  
- **Operator-grade** — designed for pressure, not convenience  
- **Veil Identity** — packets don’t reveal origin or intent

---

## 💰 Acquisition

Jumping VPN is available for acquisition.  
The protocol (VRP) is not for sale — only the VPN built on top of it.

We’re open to a **two-phase structure**:  
- 50% upfront  
- 50% upon public release on a hardened VRP core

**Valuation:** ~€500M  
📧 jumpingvpn@yahoo.com  
Subject: `Operator Acquisition`

Upon acquisition, the VPN will be finalized and released publicly,  
built on a completed, hardened VRP core.

## 🧬 Mutation Logs

Start with:

- [`MutationLog21.md`](docs/MutationLogs/MutationLog21.md) — “Drift Begins Where Routing Ends”  
- [`MutationLog22.md`](docs/MutationLogs/MutationLog22.md) — “Why VRP Refuses to Stabilize”

More logs coming soon.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository does not contain the full implementation of Jumping VPN or VRP.  
It is a **preview of architectural intent**, not a product release.

Jumping VPN is not free.  
It’s not SaaS either.  
 
You pay 19.99€ once — and you get the program.  

That includes 7 days of full access.  
After that, you choose:  
  
Stay in Free Mode (1 route, limited features)  
Or activate a plan (1/3/12/24 months)  
  
The protocol stays.  
The VPN is yours.  
The drift continues.

📦 Repository Structure

jumping-vpn/ ├── clients/        # platform-specific clients ├── docs/           # public documentation └── config/         # example configurations

Example config:

`yaml server: vpn.example.com port: 443 protocol: udp

auth: type: token token: "your-token-here"

routing: mode: "jumping" `

🧭 Status Jumping VPN is in the preparation phase.
Source code will be released in structured phases aligned with mutation cycles.

This repository is a window — not the engine.

🔹 Mock Session Demo A safe conceptual demo is available:

cd docs/demo chmod +x mock-session.sh ./mock-session.sh

Simulates:

mutation cycles
guardian observation
client heartbeat
No real routing or cryptography is exposed.
